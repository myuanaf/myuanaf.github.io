Hi, I am Minghong Yuan. I am a PhD student in Information Systems at the McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Wen Wen](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=ww6268) and [Prof. Indranil Bardhan](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=irb67). Before that, I earned my master’s degree at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and bachelor’s degree at University of Hong Kong.

My research sits at the intersection of healthcare and information technology, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies and new business models shape the delivery and value of care. I am especially interested in evaluating the socioeconomic impact of technological adoption in healthcare and generating insights to inform both policy decisions and the design of digital health innovations.

My current projects investigate:

* Private equity investment in healthcare and its implications for care quality, costs, and operational efficiency.

* The role of health information sharing in mitigating disparities in physician diagnosis and care delivery.
